# Definition: 
- Recursion : When a Function calls itself until a specified condition(Base Case) is met.
  
## Types - How Recursion could be achieved.

- **Functional Recursion :** When the Recusrion is completely dependent on how the function is getting called and is structured, i.e.  operation are performed over function calling. 
  - Reference [SumOfFirstNNumbersUsingFunction.java](SumOfFirstNNumbersUsingFunction.java).

- **Parameterised Recursion :** When the Recusrion is completely dependent on how the functions parameter are being used inside the function body and all the operations are getting performed over parameters passed.
  - Reference [SumOfFirstNNumbers.java](SumOfFirstNNumbers.java).

- **Backtracking :** When the Decrementation is the key operation in the recursive call and the function is running in reverse to achieve the given task.
  - Reference : []().
  
- **Multiple Recursion Calls:** When a function is called multiple times inside its own body.
  - Reference : [FibonacciSeriesUsingMultipleRecursionCalls.java](FibonacciSeriesUsingMultipleRecursionCalls.java).
