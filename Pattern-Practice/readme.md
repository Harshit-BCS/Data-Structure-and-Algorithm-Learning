# Star Patterns in Java

This Java program demonstrates various star patterns using nested loops.

## Pattern 1: Square of Stars

### Logic
This pattern prints a square of stars with side length equal to `n-1`. It uses two nested loops. The outer loop controls the rows, and the inner loop controls the stars in each row.

### Mathematical Logic
Each row contains `n-1` stars, forming a square grid.

### Key Concepts of Java
- Nested loops: Loops within loops are used to iterate over rows and stars in each row.
- Printing: Using `System.out.print` and `System.out.println` to print stars and move to the next line.

### Fun Fact
Java was designed with the principle of "write once, run anywhere," meaning that Java code can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

#### Output:




## Pattern 2: Right-Angled Triangle

### Logic
This pattern prints a right-angled triangle of stars, with the number of stars increasing by one in each row. It uses two nested loops.

### Mathematical Logic
Each row contains stars equal to its row number, starting from one star in the first row and increasing by one in each subsequent row.

### Key Concepts of Java
- Nested loops: Control the iteration over rows and stars in each row.
- Loop control statements: Ensuring the correct number of iterations to form the desired pattern.

### Fun Fact
Java's mascot is a small, friendly creature known as the Duke. It was created by Joe Palrang, a designer at Sun Microsystems.

#### Output:



## Pattern 3: Number Triangle

### Logic
This pattern prints a triangle of numbers, with each row containing numbers from 1 to the row number. It uses two nested loops.

### Mathematical Logic
Each row contains numbers from 1 to the row number, incrementing by 1 in each subsequent row.

### Key Concepts of Java
- Nested loops: Control the iteration over rows and numbers in each row.
- Data types: Using integers to represent numbers in the pattern.

### Fun Fact
Java was originally named Oak, after an oak tree that stood outside the window of James Gosling's office.

#### Output:



## Pattern 4: Repeated Number Triangle

### Logic
This pattern prints a triangle of repeated numbers, where each row contains the row number repeated that many times. It uses two nested loops.

### Mathematical Logic
Each row contains the row number repeated that many times, starting from 1 repetition in the first row and increasing by 1 repetition in each subsequent row.

### Key Concepts of Java
- Nested loops: Control the iteration over rows and numbers in each row.
- Data types: Using integers to represent numbers in the pattern.

### Fun Fact
Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, used for developing a wide range of applications, from mobile apps to enterprise software.

#### Output:


## Pattern 5: Inverted Right-Angled Triangle

### Logic
This pattern prints an inverted right-angled triangle of stars, with the number of stars decreasing by one in each row. It uses two nested loops.

### Mathematical Logic
Each row contains stars equal to `n` in the first row and decreases by one star in each subsequent row.

### Key Concepts of Java
- Nested loops: Control the iteration over rows and stars in each row.
- Loop control statements: Ensuring the correct number of iterations to form the desired pattern.

### Fun Fact
Java is known for its strong community support and extensive documentation, making it easier for developers to learn and use.

#### Output:



## Pattern 6: Number Triangle - Descending Order

### Logic
This pattern prints a triangle of numbers in descending order, starting from `n` in the first row. It uses two nested loops.

### Mathematical Logic
Each row contains numbers in descending order, starting from `n` in the first row and decreasing by one in each subsequent row.

### Key Concepts of Java
- Nested loops: Control the iteration over rows and numbers in each row.
- Data types: Using integers to represent numbers in the pattern.

### Fun Fact
Java has a wide range of libraries and frameworks, making it suitable for various development needs, including web development, mobile app development, and enterprise solutions.
