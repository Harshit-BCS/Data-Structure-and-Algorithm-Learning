# List Interface :

The List interface in Java represents an ordered collection of elements where each element has an index. It extends the Collection interface and is a part of the Java Collections Framework. Here's a simple overview of the List interface:

- **Ordered Collection**: Elements in a List are ordered and can be accessed by their index.
- **Duplicates Allowed**: Lists can contain duplicate elements.
- **Methods**: The List interface provides methods to add, remove, access, and manipulate elements.
- **Common Implementations**: Common implementations of the List interface include ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector.
- **Iterable**: Like other collection interfaces, List extends the Iterable interface, enabling it to be traversed using enhanced for loops.
- **Subinterfaces and Implementations**: List interface has subinterfaces like RandomAccess and implementations like AbstractList to provide additional functionality and structure.

Overall, the List interface provides a flexible and powerful way to work with collections of elements in Java, offering a wide range of operations to manage and manipulate data effectively.

Access to Vector's methods is synchronized, ensuring consistency in multi-threaded environments. | - Not thread-safe. Concurrent modifications can lead to unexpected behavior. |
| **Why Not Thread-Safe**     | - Abstract List is not synchronized to provide flexibility and allow developers to implement custom synchronization if needed. | - Abstract Sequential List is not synchronized to provide flexibility and performance. | - ArrayList is not synchronized to improve performance.  | - LinkedList is not synchronized for performance reasons. | - Vector is not thread-safe to improve performance.      | - Stack is not synchronized to improve performance.      |
| **Making Thread-Safe**      | - Implement custom synchronization in subclasses if required. | - Implement custom synchronization in subclasses if required. | - Use `Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());` to create a synchronized ArrayList. | - Use `Collections.synchronizedList(new LinkedList<>());` to create a synchronized LinkedList. | - No additional steps required.                            | - Use `Stack<Type> synchronizedStack = new Stack<>();` to create a synchronized Stack. |
| **Syntax**                  | - Abstract class, so cannot be instantiated directly.      | - Abstract class, so cannot be instantiated directly.     | ```java ArrayList<Type> list = new ArrayList<>();```      | ```java LinkedList<Type> list = new LinkedList<>();```    | ```java Vector<Type> vector = new Vector<>();```          | ```java Stack<Type> stack = new Stack<>();```            |
| **Similar Data Struct.**    | - ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector                            | - ArrayList, LinkedList                                   | - LinkedList, Vector                                      | - ArrayList, DoublyLinkedList                             | - ArrayList, LinkedList                                   | - Not applicable.                                         |
