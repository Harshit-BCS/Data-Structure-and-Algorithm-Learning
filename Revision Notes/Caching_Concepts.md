# Caching in Spring Boot Web Applications: Revision Notes

---

## Introduction to Caching

Caching is a technique used to store frequently accessed data in memory or a faster storage layer to improve application performance and reduce latency. In Spring Boot web applications, caching is often used to cache method results, database queries, or external API responses.

---

## Core Concepts

### Cache Providers

- **In-Memory Cache**: Uses the application's heap memory for caching, such as ConcurrentHashMap or Caffeine.
- **Distributed Cache**: Provides caching across multiple instances of the application, suitable for distributed environments, examples include Redis, Memcached, or Hazelcast.

### Cache Keys

- **Unique Identifier**: Each cache entry is associated with a unique key used for retrieval and invalidation.
- **Composition**: Cache keys often consist of method parameters or a combination of method name and parameters.

### Cache Eviction Policies

- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Evicts the least recently accessed entries from the cache.
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**: Evicts the least frequently accessed entries from the cache.
- **TTL (Time-To-Live)**: Removes entries from the cache after a specified period.

## Caching in Spring Boot

### @Cacheable Annotation

- **Method-Level Caching**: Annotates methods to cache their return values.
- **Parameters**: Allows specifying cache name, key generation strategy, and cache manager.

### @CachePut Annotation

- **Update Cache**: Annotates methods to update cache entries.
- **Parameters**: Similar to @Cacheable, allows specifying cache name, key generation, and cache manager.

### @CacheEvict Annotation

- **Evict Cache**: Annotates methods to remove cache entries.
- **Parameters**: Specifies cache name, key, condition, and cache manager.

### @Caching Annotation

- **Combination**: Allows combining multiple cache annotations on a single method.
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Provides fine-grained control over caching behavior.

## Integration with Cache Providers

### Redis

- **Distributed Cache**: Highly scalable, in-memory data store.
- **Spring Data Redis**: Provides easy integration with Redis in Spring Boot applications.
- **Configuration**: Requires setting up Redis server and configuring Spring Boot properties.

### Ehcache

- **In-Memory Cache**: Fast, lightweight, and easy to configure.
- **Ehcache 3**: Integration with Spring Boot using Ehcache 3.x.
- **Standalone or Distributed**: Supports both standalone and distributed configurations.

### Caffeine

- **High-Performance**: High-performance, near-optimal caching library.
- **Efficient Memory Usage**: Provides efficient memory usage and high throughput.
- **Integration with Spring Boot**: Simple integration with Spring Boot applications.

## Best Practices

### Cache Validation and Invalidation

- **Stale Data**: Ensure cache consistency by validating cached data against the source.
- **Invalidation**: Implement mechanisms to invalidate cache entries when data changes.

### Cache Sizing and Configuration

- **Memory Constraints**: Adjust cache size and eviction policies based on memory constraints.
- **Monitoring and Tuning**: Monitor cache usage and performance, tune configurations as needed.

### Use Cases and Granularity

- **Granular Caching**: Cache at the appropriate level of granularity based on use cases.
- **Avoid Over-Caching**: Avoid caching excessively, especially for volatile data.

## Conclusion

Caching is a crucial optimization technique for improving application performance and reducing latency in Spring Boot web applications. Understanding caching tools, techniques, and best practices can help developers design efficient and scalable caching solutions for their applications.
